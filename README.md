PerfCounter has been renamed!
=============================

Hello there. You may have noticed that this repository looks a bit sparse!
That's because it's living at a new location now.

https://github.com/EvanED/libperformance

You might want to check that out. Or don't. Whatever. Technically you can
still access back versions from here, but they won't be updated.

If you've actually cloned this repository, just change the file `.git/config`
so that it points to this new URL.
